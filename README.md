Project: Landing Page

This is the Landing Page project.

The purpose of this project is to build a full web page from a design 
provided by the Odin Project.

By the end, I should be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of concepts 
covered in the Foundations course so far, such as HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.
